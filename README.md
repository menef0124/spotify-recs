# spotify-recs

Web app that generates a Spotify playlist of recommendations based on a user's all-time top 50 songs and the average audio feature values of those songs.<br>
The user will be able to input their Spotify username then select 5 seeds from a list of their top 10 artists, those artists' most popular track, and any of their genres that are also in Spotify's list of valid genre seeds.<br>
At the moment, the current state of the app is just a Python script that performs the playlist generation, but a web page is still needed as a UI for the user to input their username and select their seeds.<br>
